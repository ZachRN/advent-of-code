Hey hey, this is my advent of code space. I started in 2021 when Codam had a private leaderboard.

2015 - Python - I plan on reinforcing some python skills by going back to this every so often (This was a failure, and I got bored)

2021 - Python (Partially finished in Python)

2022 - Python (Partially finished in Python)

2023 - Kotlin - I actually am forcing myself to learn a new language this year instead of just reusing python over and over and over. Hopefully learning a new skill will entertain me enough instead of slogging through with something I already know.
