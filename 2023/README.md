A second readme? Wow!

I just wanted ot list all the things I want to learn and practice about each day in Kotlin, this is mostly for myself.

Day 1 was just the basic learning, gathering knowledge on Val/Var/If/For/etc.. just the basic essentialls in order to begin the language.

Day 2 is all about learning about the Run Keyword, is it working like a lambda? Is it a go-to? A jump? Who knows I'm figuring it out.
