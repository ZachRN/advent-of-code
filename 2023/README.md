A second readme? Wow!

I just wanted ot list all the things I want to learn and practice about each day in Kotlin, this is mostly for myself.

Day 1 was just the basic learning, gathering knowledge on Val/Var/If/For/etc.. just the basic essentialls in order to begin the language.

Day 2 is all about learning about the Run Keyword, is it working like a lambda? Is it a go-to? A jump? Who knows I'm figuring it out.

Day 3 is totally about me learning global variables in Kotlin.. not being lazy at all.. I learned about init {} keyword atleast.. I also got better at making function to declare data types in it and also arrayOf vs listOf

Day 4 was regex.. even with chat.open.ai explaining to me i dont like it.. guess i need to practice it more :(

Day 5 in advace im gonna find something like printf because jfc i hate typing out println(x) println(y)
